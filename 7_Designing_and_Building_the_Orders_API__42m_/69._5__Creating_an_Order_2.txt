a new class called create order serializer. Now here we're not going to use model serializer because we're not going to use a meta class that is based on the order model. Why? Because current ID is not a field in the order class. So instead of using the model serializer, we're going to use the base serializer. And that means we don't need this meta class. We just want to explicitly define.
