event and the core app simply gets the order and prints it on a terminal. The interesting part about this model is that the store app doesn't care what happens in the core app after this order is created. Similarly, we can have many other apps that are interested in this event and every time an order is created, those apps will get notified and do something that is relevant in their domain. This is the beauty of signals.
