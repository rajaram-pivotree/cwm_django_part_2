because this is a query method, so we call it to get some data, but we are potentially changing the state or the data in the system. This is a violation of the command query separation principle, because our methods should either be commands and change the state of the system or queries, so they should return data, but not both. So how can we solve this problem? Well, we should always think about the underlying cost.
