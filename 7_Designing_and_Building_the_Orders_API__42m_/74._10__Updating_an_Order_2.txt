Now we only want to patch payment status, so everything else should be read-only. We don't want to change the customer of an order, we don't want to change when the order was placed, as well as the items. These attributes should not be touched. Now here we have two ways to implement this. Look at our order serializer class. One option is to redefine all these fields over here and mark them as read-only, except payment status.
