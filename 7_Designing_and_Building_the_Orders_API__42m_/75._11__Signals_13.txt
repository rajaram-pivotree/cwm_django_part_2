app that we can independently deploy and reuse in other projects. So everywhere we want to take the store app, we should also take the core app. And this doesn't make sense because the core app is very specific to this project. It's not something we want to reuse somewhere else. So just like before, from Django.conf, we import our settings and then we reference settings.auth user model.
