customer object, but all we need is the customer ID. So we can apply a bit of optimization here and only pick the ID field. Now, this is technically premature optimization because we haven't identified a performance problem and we're fixing it ahead of time. But this is really tiny, it's not making our code more complicated. So I think this is still a good practice here. So we get the customer ID.
