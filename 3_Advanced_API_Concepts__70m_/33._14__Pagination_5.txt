This would be a link to a previous page. You also have a results, which is an array of products. So now we can go to the second page and we see different results. Now this pagination is currently only available in the product's endpoint. So if you go to the collections endpoint, we don't have pagination. Now if you want to have pagination everywhere, we can set it globally in our settings module.
