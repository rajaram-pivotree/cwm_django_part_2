So first I like to bring stuff from Django, followed by stuff from REST framework, and then stuff from our application. There's just one tiny problem here, and that is the first statement here. So from store.filters, we're importing product filter. This is part of our application, so I like to list this at the end. And also we don't need to add the application name, so dot filters. That is better. Now we're going to use this class in our view.
