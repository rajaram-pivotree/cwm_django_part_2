key by this name. But what if we don't? This syntax is not going to work. That's why we get that error. So instead of using square brackets, we have to call the get method. The get method returns none if we don't have a key by this name. Now here we can also optionally supply a default value if we want to. In this case, we don't need it. So collection ID should be none. So this line will not get executed.
