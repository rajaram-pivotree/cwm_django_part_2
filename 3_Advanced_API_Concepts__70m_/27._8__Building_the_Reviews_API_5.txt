So here in the terminal, we're on Python, managed.py, make migrations. All right, look at the name of this migration file. The name doesn't specify the kind of change we're applied because as you can see, we have some leftover changes from before and you forgot to create a migration. So as a best practice, whenever you make any changes to your models, always create a migration. Otherwise, you will end up with a big migration file.
