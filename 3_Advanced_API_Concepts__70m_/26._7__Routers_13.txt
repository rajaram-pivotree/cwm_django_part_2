mistake and forgot to change something in this lesson. Actually, I discovered this way later in the course. Right now, I'm in the middle of section 7 and I just discovered this issue in this lesson you were watching. So, what is the issue? Well, back to our product's end point. Look, we have this delete button here, but this button should only appear when we are looking at a specific product, like product number one. But here we are looking at the list of products, so it doesn't make sense.
