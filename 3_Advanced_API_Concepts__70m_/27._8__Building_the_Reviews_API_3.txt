We're going to set on delete to models.cascade. So if we delete the product, all its reviews are deleted automatically. Now I would also like to set a related name to reviews, so in the product class will have an attribute called reviews. Next we need to define name. This is the name of the person leaving a review, so we're going to use a char field with a max length of 255. Next we define the script.
