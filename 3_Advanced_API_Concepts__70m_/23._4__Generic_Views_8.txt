Now if you pay close attention while creating this product serializer and we need to pass a context object, we have another method for that that is defined in the generic API view class. So here we can override, get serializer context, and here we can return our context object. What is that? It's a dictionary that contains the request object. So here I'm going to return a dictionary.
