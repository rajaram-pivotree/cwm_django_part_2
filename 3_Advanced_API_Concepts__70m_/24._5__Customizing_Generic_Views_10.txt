I just like the product detail view, we're overriding the delete method. So using the pk parameter, we look up this collection, then check to see if the collection has any product. If it does, we return an error. Otherwise, we delete the collection and return an empty response. And also in the URLs module over here, I called collection detail dot as view. Pretty simple. So we're done here. Let's move on to the next lesson.
