products endpoint at this address and the collections endpoint at this address. Now don't confuse this with the documentation. This is not the documentation of your API because here we cannot see what operations are available at each endpoint. We don't know if we can create a product or not. We don't know if we can update it or not. All we see is the URL of endpoint. Also, we don't know anything about the shape of our request and response object.
