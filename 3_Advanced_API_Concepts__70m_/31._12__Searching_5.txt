So even though I typed coffee in lowercase, we can still see this product. Now we can also type multiple search words. So over here, we can say coffee, space, 10 ounce, or we can separate them using a comma. Either works. So if you search, now we can only see products that have both these keywords in their title or description. So this is all about searching. Next we're going to talk about sorting.
