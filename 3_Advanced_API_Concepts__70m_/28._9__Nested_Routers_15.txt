Well, back to our serializer. You know that this serializer has a save method that would either create a review or update it. That when creating a review, it would take all these values and use them to set various fields of a review object. Now, we don't have a product ID here and that's why we're getting that exception. But how can we solve this problem? Well, back to our view set. In this view class, we have access to URL parameters.
