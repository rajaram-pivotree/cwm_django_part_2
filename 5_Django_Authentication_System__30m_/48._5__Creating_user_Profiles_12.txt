to the customers page. Currently, we don't have a customer, so let's add a new customer. I'm gonna supply some value for the phone and membership. Now here we have a dropdown list for our users, so we can associate a customer with an existing user. Now in a real word scenario, we wanna replace this dropdown list with an autocomplete box, but I'm gonna leave it up to you as an additional exercise. So let's associate this with the admin user.
