in our custom user model will end up in this table. With the second approach, we're not going to extend this table, we'll have a separate table and in that table, we'll have a foreign key to the user table. So practically speaking, we should use the first approach only for storing attributes related to authentication. Anything that impacts the authentication process. Anything extra that is not related to authentication should really go in a profile table.
