Now let's imagine that in the future, we want to allow our users to log in with their email. So here we need to apply a unique constraint on the email column. And this is a valid use case for extending the user model because we're changing something related to authentication. Okay? So back to our project, we need to create a new user model. But where should we add that model? We don't want to add it in the store app because this app is for building an online store.
