Over here, I can create a new product, I can even update or delete products. Certainly, we don't want this to happen. We want only admin users to be able to modify products, but anyone, including anonymous users, should be able to retrieve the list of products. Now, back to DjangoRestFrameworks documentation. Look here on the Permissions page, we don't currently have a class called IsAdmin or Read Only. We only have IsAutomatically.
