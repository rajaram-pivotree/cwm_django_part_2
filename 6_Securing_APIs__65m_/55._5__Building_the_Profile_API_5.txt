set. Now this can be a model view set, but model view set is not a good choice here because we don't want to support all operations at this endpoint. For example, we don't want to list customers. That is something that we only need on the admin panel. So a web or a mobile app talking to our API doesn't really need a list of customers. So what operations do we need here? We should be able to create a customer, retrieve a customer and update it.
