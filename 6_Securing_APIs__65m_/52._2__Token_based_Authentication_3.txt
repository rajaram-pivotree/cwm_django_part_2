protected resources. So the client is going to store this locally and next time it needs to access protected resources, it's going to send it to the server. For example, let's say the user wants to look at their profile. So the client needs to send a request to this endpoint and it should pass the token and the request header. Now once again, on the server, we're going to read the token, we're going to validate it. If it's valid and not expired, we're going to give access to this resource.
