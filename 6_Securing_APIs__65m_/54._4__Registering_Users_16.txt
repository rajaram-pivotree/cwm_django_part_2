capture it from the client. So I don't know what I was thinking, but that was a mistake and I'm sorry about that. Now, to save this, we need to override the save method and change how this data is saved. So first we create a user record and then we create a profile record. But this is not the right way to implement this because this serializer is purely responsible for deserializing user data and creating a user record.
