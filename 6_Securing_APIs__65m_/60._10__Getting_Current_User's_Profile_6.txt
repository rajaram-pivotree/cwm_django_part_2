authentication middleware. Remember, let's quickly jump to the middleware section of the settings module. So here we have this authentication middleware. The job of this middleware is to inspect the incoming request and if there is information about the user, it's going to retrieve that user from the database and attach it to the request object. So, back to our view set. Every request has a user attribute.
