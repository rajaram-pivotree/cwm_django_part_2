Welcome back to another section of the Ultimate Django course. In this section, you're going to learn how to secure your API endpoints using Permissions. So we'll start off by talking about token-based authentication, which is the de facto standard for authenticating users with restful APIs. Then we'll add authentication endpoints to our API and allow users to register, log in, log out, and so on. And finally, we'll apply a bunch of permissions.
