for managing our customers. Now, as you can see, the get method is not allowed because we don't want to allow the client to retrieve the list of all customers, OK? But we can create a new customer. Here we have phone, birth date, and membership, but user ID is missing. So back to our serializer. Even though in the customer model, we have the user ID attribute, this attribute is created dynamically at runtime. So we need to explain this.
