and a separate library. Now, what is the difference? Well, token-based authentication built in Django-Rest Framework uses a database table to store tokens. So every time we receive a request on the server to validate the token, this backend is gonna go to the database to make sure this is a valid token. So that's gonna incur a database call for every request. In contrast, JSON WebToken authentication doesn't need a database.
