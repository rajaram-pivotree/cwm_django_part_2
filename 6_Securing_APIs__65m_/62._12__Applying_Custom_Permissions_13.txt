All right, look, we applied this permission over here, and that's good, but I just noticed a problem. Earlier, we used these mixings here, create, retrieve, and update, because I assume that using this API, we don't want to list or delete our customers. I assume that we want to perform these tasks via the admin panel, but let's change the requirements a little bit. Let's make this endpoint consistent with our products and collections endpoints.
