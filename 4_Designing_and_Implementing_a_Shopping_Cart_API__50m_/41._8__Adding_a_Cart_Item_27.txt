Here I'm going to use min value of validator. We talk about this in the first part of the course. So we can pass a validator object here and set the minimum value to 1. Now refresh down the bottom. Let's set product ID to 1 and quantity to 0. OK, we got a different error saying the quantity should be at least 1. Beautiful. So we're done with this step. Next, we're going to talk about updating a cart ID.
