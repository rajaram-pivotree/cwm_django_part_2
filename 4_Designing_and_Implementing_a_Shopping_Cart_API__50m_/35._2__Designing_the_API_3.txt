Note that the body of the request is empty here, because as I told you before, our cards are anonymous. So we don't want to force users to log in before they can add items to their shopping card. So when creating a card, we're not going to send someone's user ID or customer ID to get a card back. So we send a post request to this endpoint and we get a card object from the server. Now this card object has a unique identifier that we're going to save on the client for subsequent requests.
