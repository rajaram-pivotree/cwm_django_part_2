patch request to this other endpoint. And here we have two URL parameters. The first one is the CartIDeme. And the second one is the item ID. Now in the body of the request, we're going to send the quantity. And in the response, we'll get the updated quantity. So here we're going to support only patch requests, not put requests, because with put, we can replace an entire object. But in this case, we're not going to replace an entire item. We just want to update its quantity.
