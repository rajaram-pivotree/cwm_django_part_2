slash one. Now there's a problem here. The problem is that a hacker can easily guess someone else's cart ID and send the request to this endpoint to mess with that cart because it's really easy to guess these numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on, right? So to solve this problem, we're going to use a grid or a globally unique identifier, which is a long 32 character string. It's going to make it much harder for a hacker to guess that string.
