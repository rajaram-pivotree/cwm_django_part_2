use GWT, but internally we're going to translate that GWT to a number. So that's going to complicate our queries a little bit. That's why I'm totally against premature optimization. You always have to pay cost for these optimizations. Your code is going to get more complicated. There is a chance you introduce new bugs and also you may end up with other performance problems. So we're going to keep this change and run our migration. So back in the terminal, Python matters.
