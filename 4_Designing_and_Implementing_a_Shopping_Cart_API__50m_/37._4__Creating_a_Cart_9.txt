Now at this endpoint, we don't support a get operation. So look, if we send a get request to this endpoint, we get HTTP 405, which means method not allowed. But we can post to this endpoint. So over here, we can post an object. Now there's a tiny issue here. ID is set to null, but we don't want to send the ID to the server. We want to send an empty object. How can we solve this problem? Well, what you see here comes from our serializer.
