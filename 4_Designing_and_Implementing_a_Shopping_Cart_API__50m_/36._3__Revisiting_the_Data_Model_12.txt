Also, all these database engines are highly optimized. So I don't think we should do any kind of optimization here before we do a proper test and make sure this is going to be an issue. As I always say in my courses, premature optimization is the root of all evils. So don't assume right from the get go that this solution is going to be slow and then make it complicated. But in case you're curious, let me briefly talk about an alternative optimized solution. The other solution is to keep this structure in
