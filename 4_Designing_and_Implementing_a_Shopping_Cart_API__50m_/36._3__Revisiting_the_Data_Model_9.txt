So we're going to store 22 additional megabytes of data. Is this an issue? In my opinion, no. These days, this place is so cheap and 22 megabytes for one million records is really nothing. Also, take into account that this is really a temporary table. It's not going to grow indefinitely. So as people place orders, we're going to move these records to our order and order item tables. In those tables, we're not going to use quits. We're just going to use integers.
