Look, currently we have only seven queries. So the first view as you know, are always there. Now for getting a cart, we have a query to retrieve the cart. Then we have another query to retrieve the items in the cart and want to retrieve all products, reference in this cart. So we don't have a separate query, prayer item. We're done with this operation. I know that was quite a lot of work.
