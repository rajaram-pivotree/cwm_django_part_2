So in this serializer, we cannot rely on the default implementation of the save method that comes from model serializer. We have to re-implement the save method based on the requirements of our application. So, this overwrite the save method that here we need to get the product ID and quantity. Where do we get that? Well, earlier I told you that. Behind the scene, there is a call to serializer.
