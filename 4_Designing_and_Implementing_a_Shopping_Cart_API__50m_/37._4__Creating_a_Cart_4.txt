that because this class provides all operations, list, retrieve, create, update, and delete. But look at the operations we need to support for our cards. We need to be able to create a card, get a card, and delete it. So here we don't have a list operation. So we cannot send a get request to the card's endpoint and retrieve all cards. Otherwise, all our card ideas are going to be exposed to the outside. We don't want to do that. And similarly, we don't have an update.
