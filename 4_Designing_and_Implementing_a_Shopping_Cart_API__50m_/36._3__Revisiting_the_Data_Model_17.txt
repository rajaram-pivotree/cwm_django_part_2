for the same product in the same cart. So how do we do that? Using a meta class, so class meta. And here we set Unic together to a list of lists because we can have multiple unique constraints on different fields. For example, we can have a constraint on cart and product, but we can have another constraint on two or three other fields. That's why we have a list of different fields.
