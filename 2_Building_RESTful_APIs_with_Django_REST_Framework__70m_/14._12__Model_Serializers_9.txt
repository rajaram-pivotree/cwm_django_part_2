Instead of sending fields to an array, we can set it to a special string like this. Double underscore, all double underscore. That means all fields in a product class. Now, why is this a bad practice? Because we don't want to automatically include every field in our product class. If tomorrow we decide to add a new field in the product class, that field will automatically be exposed to the outside world. And this is against all the concepts I talked about earlier.
