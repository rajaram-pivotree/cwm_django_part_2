We want this request to be handled by a view function called collection underline detail. Currently, we don't have this view function, so let's go ahead and create it. We're going to go to our views module and down the bottom, we're going to create a new view function. So collection underline detail with two parameters request and ID. Now, for now, I just want to return a response of, okay.
