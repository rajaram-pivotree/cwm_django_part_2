I'm going to call this unit price. And here we're going to set this to serializers.decemodfield. The decimal fields have two arguments that we need to set. Max digits, I'm going to set it to 6, and decimal places to 2. Okay? So this is how we define a serializer. Now that we have a serializer, we can use it to convert a product object to a Python dictionary. And that's what I'm going to show you next.
