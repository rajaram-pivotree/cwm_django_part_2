Alright, the last thing we're going to talk about in this section is deleting a product. We're going to implement this operation in the product detail view function because this is where we worked with a particular product. So first we need to add the delete method right here. Now note that the moment we add this method here, if we go back to the browser and refresh, we see a delete button here.
