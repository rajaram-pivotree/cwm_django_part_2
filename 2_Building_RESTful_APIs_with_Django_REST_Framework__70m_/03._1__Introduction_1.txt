Alright, we're going to start this course with an introduction to RESTful APIs. So in this section we'll be talking about RESTful APIs, what they are and how they work. Then we'll install Django REST Framework, which is the most popular framework for building web APIs with Django. Once we do that, then we'll talk about some of the fundamental concepts such as creating API views, creating serializers, serializing and deserializing models and much, much more.
