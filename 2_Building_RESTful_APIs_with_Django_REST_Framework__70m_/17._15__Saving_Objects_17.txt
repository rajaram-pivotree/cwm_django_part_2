This product object automatically includes the ID that was generated on the server. Okay. Now let's try to update the product. So I'm going to go to products slash two. Now at the save time, I'm going to copy this object, put it in the request body and make a few small changes. First, we're going to remove the ID. Then for the title, we're going to add a plus sign here so we know it's updated.
