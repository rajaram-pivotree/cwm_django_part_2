But because the collection class doesn't have this field, I had to define it here in the serializer as an integer field. Otherwise, we will get an exception. Okay. Now, back to review function. Next, if you have a post request, then just like before, we're going to deserialize the data, we're going to validate it and then save it in a database. Nothing new here. Now, we also have this collection.
