See, our code is immediately more readable. That's better. So this is how we can handle the situation where a product doesn't exist. But repeating this pattern every time is time consuming. That's where we use Django shortcut. So on the top, look, we have a statement here from Django.shortcuts for importing the render function. But render is not used here. Instead, we're going to import get object or 404.
