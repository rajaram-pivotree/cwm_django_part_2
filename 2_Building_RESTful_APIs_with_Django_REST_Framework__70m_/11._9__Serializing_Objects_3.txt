product serializer, and here we pass our product object. Now, the moment we create this serializer, this serializer will convert our product object to a dictionary, and we can get that dictionary from serializer.data. So, instead of including the ID in the response, we're going to include serializer.data. Now, in this implementation, I'm not using a JSON render that I told you about in the previous lesson.
