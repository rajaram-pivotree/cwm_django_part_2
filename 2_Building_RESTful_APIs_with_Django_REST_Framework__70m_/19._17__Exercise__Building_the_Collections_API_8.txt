exactly like how we retrieve the product. Now updating a collection is also the same, but we have a slight change in deleting a collection. So here we're checking to see if this collection has any products. So if collection.product.count is greater than zero, we return an error to the client saying, this collection cannot be deleted because it includes one or more products. And by the way, you can get the completed code in the zip file that I give you.
