As we said, we can have a bunch of key value pairs or properties. So here we have name, age, is online, and so on. Now note that the keys are always strings, so they should be surrounded with double codes. The values on the other hand can be anything. So in this example, the value of the name property is a string, the age is a number, is online is a Boolean, employer is an object, so you can have its own properties.
